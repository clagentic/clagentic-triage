# clagentic:triage — Configuration Reference

Configuration is loaded from (in priority order):
1. Environment variables (prefix: `CLAGENTIC_TRIAGE_`)
2. `triage.config.json` in the working directory
3. `~/.config/clagentic/triage/config.json`

## Key fields

### `source`

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `adapter` | `"github"` | Source adapter (`github`, `gitlab`, `forgejo`) |
| `org` | `null` | GitHub org to watch. If set, all repos in the org are fetched unless `repos` is specified. |
| `repos` | `["*"]` | Repos to watch in `owner/repo` format. `*` = all repos in `org`. |
| `poll_interval_seconds` | `60` | How often to poll for new events (seconds). |
| `allow_bot_logins` | `[]` | Bot logins **exempted** from the bot-event filter (DD-005) — i.e. bots that should still be triaged. Inverse of `ignore_logins`. Use sparingly. Do not confuse with `ignore_logins`: this list *lets bots through*, it does not add bots to the deny list. |
| `watch_associations` | `["CONTRIBUTOR", "FIRST_TIME_CONTRIBUTOR", "FIRST_TIMER", "NONE", "MANNEQUIN"]` | Actor-association filter (DD-008). Only events whose GitHub `author_association` is in this list are triaged. Default = external contributors only (`OWNER`/`MEMBER`/`COLLABORATOR` excluded). **`CONTRIBUTOR` is included by default and does NOT imply "external" on every repo** — any account with write access (including a crew/build bot granted write access) can be assessed as `CONTRIBUTOR`, not just genuine outside contributors. If your deployment grants write access to automation, that automation's PRs will pass this bucket check unless its login is also in `ignore_logins` or it is caught by the bot filter (`[bot]`-suffixed logins / `type: "Bot"` senders are excluded regardless of association — DD-005). Valid values: `OWNER`, `MEMBER`, `COLLABORATOR`, `CONTRIBUTOR`, `FIRST_TIME_CONTRIBUTOR`, `FIRST_TIMER`, `NONE`, `MANNEQUIN`. Unknown values are rejected at load. |
| `ignore_logins` | `[]` **— populate this before deploying (see warning below)** | Logins always skipped, regardless of association (deny). Must include: the operator's own username, and every crew/automation login that is not already `[bot]`-suffixed (a `[bot]`-suffixed login is already caught by the bot filter — DD-005 — but a plain-named service/CI account is not). Wins over everything. |
| `watch_logins` | `[]` | Logins always processed, even if their association is not in `watch_associations` (allow). Lets you watch a specific internal person. |
| `max_events_per_author_per_poll` | `20` | Maximum events passed downstream per author per poll window. Applied after the bot and actor-association filters; filtered events do not count. `0` or `null` disables the cap. Stateless — counts reset each poll call. Protects against a single noisy actor flooding the assessment queue. |
| `max_events_per_repo_per_poll` | `200` | Maximum post-filter events accumulated per repo per poll. Pagination stops once this many events have passed all filters for a repo. This cap operates on the post-filter event count, so a high-volume author whose events are dropped by the per-author cap cannot consume the budget and starve legitimate contributors. `0` or `null` disables the cap. |
| `github_app_id` | `null` | GitHub App numeric ID. When set, the adapter mints installation tokens instead of using `CLAGENTIC_TRIAGE_GITHUB_TOKEN`. Use App auth or PAT — not both. |
| `github_app_private_key_env` | `"CLAGENTIC_TRIAGE_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY"` | Name of the env var that holds the RS256 private key PEM inline. The PEM is never stored on the config object — only the env var name is. Override if you store the key under a different env var name. Takes precedence over `github_app_private_key_path` when both resolve to a value. |
| `github_app_private_key_path` | `null` | Path to a file containing the RS256 private key PEM. Read at mint time; used only when the inline env var (above) is unset/empty. See `docs/GITHUB_APP.md` for the full precedence and newline-escaping rules — this is the recommended option for systemd/Docker/k8s deployments where the key arrives as a mounted file. |
| `github_app_installation_id` | `null` | Installation numeric ID. Found in the installation URL on GitHub. Required when `github_app_id` is set. |

The actor-association filter is orthogonal to the bot filter — both apply, and an
event must pass both to be triaged. Precedence: `ignore_logins` (deny) → `watch_logins`
(allow) → `watch_associations` bucket. An event with a missing/unknown association
is treated as external and processed (fail-open). See DD-008 for the full rationale.

> **`ignore_logins` defaults to `[]` — this is required-in-practice config, not
> optional hardening (lr-af2104).** `watch_associations`'s default excludes
> `OWNER`/`MEMBER`/`COLLABORATOR`, and `allow_bot_logins`'s default (`[]`) means
> any `[bot]`-suffixed or `type: "Bot"` account is filtered out of the box — but
> neither of those defaults can know **who the operator is** or **which bot
> logins belong to the operator's own automation** (a build/crew bot with a
> `[bot]`-suffixed login is already excluded by the bot filter; a bot-like
> automation account that does *not* end in `[bot]`, or a CI/service account
> with write access assessed as `CONTRIBUTOR`, is not). If you (the repo
> owner/operator) or any automation you run also opens PRs or issues against a
> repo triage watches, **you must add your own login and every such automation
> login to `ignore_logins` before deploying** — an empty `ignore_logins` on a
> repo where the operator or crew automation is active will let their own
> activity reach the pending queue as if it were an external contributor
> signal. This is not a hypothetical: a deployment with empty `ignore_logins`
> against a repo where both the operator and a crew build bot were active
> accumulated dozens of internal PRs in the pending queue before this was
> caught (lr-af2104). `docs/DESIGN-DECISIONS.md` DD-017 has the full incident
> writeup.

### `runner` / `model` / `runner_url` / `runner_api_key_env`

`runner` selects the LLM backend. `model` is the model hint passed to that backend.

| `runner` | Description |
|---|---|
| `"claude-cli"` | Default. Spawns the `claude` CLI as a subprocess. `model` is passed as `--model`. Requires `claude` on PATH or `CLAUDE_PATH`. The CLI must be authenticated on the machine running clagentic:triage — this runner does not work in containers or on hosts without an active OAuth session. |
| `"anthropic-api"` | HTTP POST to `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages`. API key read from the env var named in `runner_api_key_env` (default: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`). No CLI required. |
| `"openai-compatible"` | HTTP POST to `${runner_url}/chat/completions`. Covers OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Ollama, clagentic:router, and any OpenAI-compatible server. If the key env var is empty (e.g. Ollama local), the Authorization header is omitted. This is the recommended runner for hosted or containerized deployments. |
| `"clagentic-router"` | HTTP POST to `${runner_url}/v1/assess`. Legacy runner for a private router protocol not implemented in the public clagentic:router release. **Prefer `openai-compatible` pointing at a clagentic:router instance** — it speaks the standard `/v1/chat/completions` path that router exposes. |

**`runner_url`** — base URL for `openai-compatible` and `clagentic-router`. Required for `openai-compatible`; ignored for `claude-cli` and `anthropic-api`.

**`runner_api_key_env`** — the **name** of the environment variable that holds the API key (never the key itself). Leave unset to use the runner's default (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or `CLAGENTIC_ROUTER_TOKEN`).

**Minimal standalone setup (claude CLI, on the same host as OAuth session):**
```json
{ "runner": "claude-cli", "model": "claude-haiku-4-5" }
```

**Anthropic API directly (no CLI, no router — just an API key):**
```json
{ "runner": "anthropic-api", "model": "claude-haiku-4-5", "runner_api_key_env": "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" }
```

**clagentic:router (recommended for self-hosted multi-backend setups):**

clagentic:router is a self-hosted LLM routing daemon that exposes an OpenAI-compatible API and walks a configurable fallback chain across backends (Claude CLI, Anthropic API, OpenAI, Ollama, etc.). Run it on a host where OAuth sessions are active; point clagentic:triage at it from anywhere on the same network.

```json
{
  "runner": "openai-compatible",
  "runner_url": "http://your-router-host:8765/v1",
  "runner_api_key_env": "CLAGENTIC_ROUTER_TOKEN",
  "model": "role:triage"
}
```

The `model` field is passed to router as the chain selector. Use `role:<chain-name>` to select a named chain from router's config (e.g. `role:triage` for a cheap-model-first chain), `backend:<id>` to target a specific backend, or `chain:alias1,alias2` for an explicit fallback sequence. See clagentic:router documentation for chain configuration.

**Ollama local (no auth):**
```json
{ "runner": "openai-compatible", "model": "llama3", "runner_url": "http://localhost:11434/v1" }
```

**Deprecation note:** `model: "clagentic:router"` is deprecated. On load, it is automatically
migrated to `runner: "clagentic-router"` and `model: "auto"` with a warning. Update your config
to use `runner: "openai-compatible"` pointing at your clagentic:router instance.

### `confidence_threshold`

Default: `0.7`. Verdicts with confidence below this value are always routed to
the HITL pending queue, regardless of `auto_approve` configuration. This gate
cannot be bypassed by `auto_approve`.

### `auto_approve`

List of action classes that execute immediately without human review:

| Class | Effect |
|---|---|
| `respond` | Post a comment on the issue/PR |
| `request_changes` | Submit a request-changes review on a PR |
| `close` | Close the issue or PR |
| `dispatch` | Create a task in configured dispatchers |
| `escalate` | Route to human review (effectively a no-op for auto-approve) |
| `approve` | Approve a PR — **requires `allow_auto_pr_approval: true`** |

Default: `[]` (fully human-in-the-loop).

### `allow_auto_pr_approval`

Default: `false`. Must be explicitly set to `true` before `"approve"` can be
added to `auto_approve`. This is a deliberate friction point — autonomous PR
approval carries real consequences on live repos. See DD-001 and DD-002 in
`docs/DESIGN-DECISIONS.md`.

### `allow_overprivileged_token`

Default: `false`. When a classic PAT with broad OAuth scopes (e.g. `repo`,
`admin:org`) is used alongside write action classes in `auto_approve`
(`respond`, `close`, `request_changes`, `approve`, `dispatch`), clagentic-triage
emits a startup warning because a compromised token can take write actions across
every repo in scope.

Set `allow_overprivileged_token: true` to silence the warning when you have
intentionally accepted this risk — for example, in a development environment or
when the token is scoped to a dedicated test org.

The preferred alternative is to use a fine-grained PAT scoped to the specific
repos you want to triage, or to configure a GitHub App (see
`docs/GITHUB_APP.md`). GitHub App installation tokens are already narrowly
scoped and are not subject to this check.

### `auto_label`

Default: `false`. When `true`, labels suggested by the LLM are applied to
queued items immediately (without waiting for human approval of the full action).

### `label_auto_approve` (T10, lr-9e35)

Default: `[]` (fully HITL, DD-001 posture). Per-axis trust for intake
`kind/*`/`priority/*`/`area/*` suggestions, separate from `auto_approve`
(which gates action classes) and from the `status/*` axis (governed by
`auto_approve`/`auto_label` as before). List the axis names you trust:

```json
{ "label_auto_approve": ["kind"] }
```

This trusts `kind/*` suggestions (e.g. `kind/bug`, `kind/feature`) to be
applied automatically — on both auto-approved and `auto_label`-queued
items — while `priority/*` and `area/*` suggestions still require a human to
apply them via `clagentic-triage review`/`approve`. An axis not listed here is
never auto-applied, regardless of `auto_label`. Each entry must be a known
axis name from `labels.axes` (see below); the status namespace itself is
rejected here — its trust is governed by `auto_approve`/`auto_label`, not this
key.

### `pre_filter`

Optional tier-1 cheap LLM pass that classifies events as noise or real before
running the full assessor. Off by default. See DD-011 in `docs/DESIGN-DECISIONS.md`
and `docs/SPAM_PROTECTION.md` for when and how to enable it.

```json
{
  "pre_filter": {
    "enabled": false,
    "runner": "claude-cli",
    "model": "claude-haiku-4-5",
    "timeout_ms": 15000,
    "confidence_threshold": 0.8
  }
}
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Enable the pre-filter. Off by default — enable once you have confidence in the threshold for your event stream. |
| `runner` | main `runner` | Runner to use for tier-1 calls. Route to a cheap/fast model here. `openai-compatible` pointing at a clagentic:router instance or a local Ollama server works well. |
| `model` | main `model` | Model for tier-1 calls. |
| `timeout_ms` | main `llm_timeout_ms` | Timeout for pre-filter calls. |
| `confidence_threshold` | `0.8` | Minimum confidence to drop an event as noise. Below this threshold the event passes through to the main assessor. Intentionally high — uncertain classifications pass. |

Pre-filter failures (LLM error, parse error, timeout) always degrade to pass-through.
A failing pre-filter never blocks the pipeline.

## Dispatchers

Dispatchers receive events after assessment and create tasks in external systems
(Jira, Linear, webhooks, etc.). They fire on the `dispatch` action class.

```json
{
  "dispatchers": [
    { "name": "webhook", "url": "https://example.com/triage-hook" },
    { "name": "my-backend", "module": "./backends/my-backend.js", "config": {} }
  ]
}
```

Each entry must have either `name` (bundled dispatcher) or `module` (operator-supplied
module path or npm specifier). `config` is optional and passed to the dispatcher.

Bundled dispatchers: `noop` (logs only), `webhook` (HTTP POST). See `docs/DISPATCHERS.md`
for the dispatcher interface contract.

## Hooks

Hooks are lightweight callbacks that fire after every assessment, regardless of the
verdict. They run before the pending queue is written. Hook failures are logged as
warnings — they never affect the pipeline outcome.

```json
{
  "hooks": [
    {
      "name": "console",
      "config": {
        "command": "clagentic-console",
        "args": [],
        "prompt_via": "flag"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Each entry must have either `name` (bundled hook) or `module` (operator-supplied
module path or npm specifier). `config` is optional and passed to the hook's `run`
function.

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | one of `name`/`module` | Bundled hook name. Must match `/^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$/`. |
| `module` | one of `name`/`module` | Operator-supplied module path (relative/absolute within cwd, or npm specifier). |
| `config` | no | Hook-specific config object passed to `run()`. |

### Bundled hook: `console`

Launches `clagentic-console` when the triage verdict is `escalate`. The hook is
fire-and-forget — the CLI session starts in a detached process; the pipeline does not
wait for it to finish. Non-escalate verdicts are silently skipped.

```json
{
  "name": "console",
  "config": {
    "command": "clagentic-console",
    "args": [],
    "prompt_via": "flag"
  }
}
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `command` | `"clagentic-console"` | CLI binary to invoke. Must be on PATH or an absolute path. |
| `args` | `[]` | Extra arguments prepended before the prompt. Use for flags like `--profile myprofile`. |
| `prompt_via` | `"flag"` | How to pass the prompt: `"flag"` passes `--message <prompt>` as a CLI argument; `"stdin"` writes the prompt to the process stdin. |

The prompt contains: repo, issue/PR number, title, verdict, confidence score, and
suggested action. It is a single concise paragraph — enough context for a console
session to start immediately.

## Intent file

The primary intent file is a YAML file committed to each watched repo at
`.github/triage-intent.yml`. It tells the LLM what belongs in the repo.

```yaml
# .github/triage-intent.yml
repo_context_files:
  - path: CONTRIBUTING.md
  - path: docs/ROADMAP.md

triage_rules:
  - id: default
    description: "General triage rules"
    llm_context: |
      Accept bug reports with reproduction steps and expected/actual behavior.
      Request info if steps are missing.
      Redirect support questions to Discussions.
```

`repo_context_files` lists additional files in the repo whose contents are
injected into the LLM context. Only documentation-style extensions are allowed
(`.md`, `.txt`, `.yml`, `.yaml`, `.json`, `.rst`). Credential files, private
keys, and `.env` files are blocked regardless of the intent file's contents.

If no YAML file is found, the assessor falls back to `.github/TRIAGE_INTENT.md`
(Markdown), then to a built-in generic intent.

See [INTENT_AUTHORING.md](INTENT_AUTHORING.md) for guidance on writing effective
intent files — what to put in `llm_context`, how to tune for confidence, and how
to iterate safely before enabling `auto_approve`.

## Webhook server

Real-time event delivery via GitHub webhooks. Disabled by default.

```json
{
  "webhooks": {
    "enabled": true,
    "port": 8742,
    "secret": "your-webhook-secret-here"
  }
}
```

**`webhooks.secret` must be a non-empty string when `enabled` is `true`.** An
empty secret is rejected at config load time. Expose the webhook endpoint behind
a reverse proxy — the default bind address is `127.0.0.1`, not `0.0.0.0`.

### Webhook rate limiting

Two independent caps protect the inbound event stream from noisy or abusive senders:

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `webhooks.rate_limit_window_seconds` | `60` | Sliding window length (seconds) for the per-author event cap. Each author's counter resets independently when this many seconds have elapsed since their window started. |
| `webhooks.max_events_per_minute` | `300` | Global cap: maximum events processed across all authors in any 60-second bucket. When exceeded, the server returns `429 Too Many Requests` and logs a warning. Use this to guard against distributed floods from many unique actors. |

The per-author cap reuses the `source.max_events_per_author_per_poll` threshold
(default `20`) — no additional config key is needed. An author who sends more
than that many events within `rate_limit_window_seconds` receives `429` until
the window expires. Both caps are in-memory and reset on process restart.

## Status-callback server (closed-loop status back-post)

Generic inbound channel that lets any configured dispatcher backend (lore, Jira,
Linear, an internal tool) report a dispatched task's terminal state back to
clagentic:triage. See DD-013 in `docs/DESIGN-DECISIONS.md` for the full design.
Disabled by default.

```json
{
  "status_hooks": {
    "enabled": true,
    "port": 8743,
    "secret": "your-status-hook-secret-here",
    "path": "/status-hook"
  },
  "release_notify": {
    "comment_template": "Shipped in {version}: {task_url}"
  }
}
```

**`status_hooks.secret` must be a non-empty string when `enabled` is `true`** — the
same RT-004 posture as the webhook server. This is a **separate secret** from
`webhooks.secret`: the two channels authenticate different callers (GitHub vs.
whichever backend the operator configured) and must not share a trust boundary.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `status_hooks.enabled` | `false` | Start the status-callback server in `watch` mode. |
| `status_hooks.port` | `8743` | Listen port. Distinct from `webhooks.port` so both servers can run side by side. |
| `status_hooks.secret` | `""` | HMAC-SHA256 secret. Required when `enabled` is `true`. |
| `status_hooks.bind` | `"127.0.0.1"` | Bind address. Expose externally via a reverse proxy. |
| `status_hooks.path` | `"/status-hook"` | HTTP path the server listens on. |
| `release_notify.comment_template` | `"Shipped in {version}: {task_url}"` | Comment body template. Placeholders: `{version}`, `{task_url}`, `{task_id}`, `{repo}`, `{number}`. |
| `task_index` | `".triage/task-index.jsonl"` | Path to the durable task_id -> origin side-index (`src/task_index.js`). |

### Sending a status-callback request

```
POST /status-hook
X-Clagentic-Signature: sha256=<hmac-sha256 hex of the raw body, using status_hooks.secret>
Content-Type: application/json

{ "task_id": "lr-a68f", "dispatcher": "lore", "status": "shipped", "version": "0.9.0" }
```

- `task_id` (required) — the id returned by the dispatcher's `create_task()`.
- `dispatcher` (optional, recommended) — narrows the task-index lookup to a specific
  dispatcher's id space.
- `status` (required) — only `"shipped"` is currently handled; other values are
  acknowledged (`200 { status: "ignored" }`) and otherwise no-op.
- `version` (optional) — included in the rendered comment template.

An unknown `task_id` (never dispatched, or dispatched before the task-index existed)
is acknowledged with `200 { status: "unknown_task_id" }` rather than an error.
Repeated calls for the same `(task_id, version)` are idempotent — the comment is not
re-posted and the `released` label is not re-applied.

## Auto-transitions off PR events (T10, lr-9e35)

When a PR is opened linking an issue via a closing keyword (`Closes #NN`), or a
linked draft PR is marked ready for review, clagentic:triage automatically
transitions the linked issue's `status/*` label — the same deterministic,
non-LLM-assessed pattern the PR-merge/release transitions use
(`docs/DESIGN-DECISIONS.md`, T6). No config flag gates this — it activates
whenever the PR-merge/release lifecycle poll already applies (i.e. whenever
the adapter implements `list_lifecycle_events`).

| PR state | Linked issue transition |
|---|---|
| Opened, still a draft | `status/in-progress` |
| Opened directly as non-draft, or a draft PR marked ready for review | `status/in-review` |
| Merged to the default branch | `status/awaiting-release` (existing, T6) |

Both transitions never regress an issue that has already advanced past their
target status (e.g. a stale poll re-observing an old PR never reverts
`status/awaiting-release` back to `status/in-progress`).

## Stale needs-info auto-close (T10, lr-9e35)

Modeled on [`actions/stale`](https://github.com/actions/stale)'s own defaults:
an issue marked `status/needs-info` gets a warning comment after N idle days,
then closes after M further idle days with no response. Disabled by default.

```json
{
  "stale": {
    "enabled": true,
    "needs_info_days": 60,
    "close_after_days": 7,
    "exempt_labels": ["pinned"],
    "stale_comment_template": "This issue has had no activity for {days} days while marked needs-info. It will be closed in {close_after_days} days if no update is provided.",
    "close_comment_template": "Closing due to inactivity — no update was provided after the needs-info notice."
  }
}
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `stale.enabled` | `false` | Enable the sweep. Runs once per `run`/`watch` poll cycle. |
| `stale.needs_info_days` | `60` | Idle days (measured from the issue's `updated_at`) before the warning comment posts. Matches `actions/stale`'s default. |
| `stale.close_after_days` | `7` | Further idle days after the warning before the issue is closed. Matches `actions/stale`'s default. |
| `stale.exempt_labels` | `[]` | Labels that exempt an issue from the sweep entirely, even if it carries `status/needs-info`. |
| `stale.stale_comment_template` | see above | Warning comment body. Placeholders: `{days}`, `{close_after_days}`. |
| `stale.close_comment_template` | see above | Comment posted immediately before the issue is closed (best-effort — a comment failure does not block the close). No placeholders. |

Idle time is derived from the issue's live `updated_at` (GitHub's own
last-activity timestamp), not a parallel store. The warning is idempotent per
idle window — a repeat sweep checks existing comments for a marker before
posting a second warning.
